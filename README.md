# Bootcamp Final Project
## 🎉Alquisfraces🎭
Alquisfraces is a project created by **_Las Adas_**. Team formed by Camila Montealegre, Verónica Alcaraz and Melissa Gallo, passionate about programming, for the PionerasDev & Globant 2020 Bootcamp. Our mentor was Andrea Córdoba and our client was Maria Gladys, Melissa Gallo's mother, who actually has a costume rental business. The construction of this project was from scratch, without knowing anything about React, some of us, at the beginning of the Bootcamp had no approach to programming. We wanted to learn how to implement applications using React, to solve a real problem with an application, creating a scheduling system and a nice user experience.
